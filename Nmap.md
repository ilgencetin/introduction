## MAP 
- When we tried to attack somewhere, firstly we need to create a map to see our _landscape._ 
- _Landscape_ generally includes port scanning
- Network connections are made between two ports - an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer.
- Every computer has total of **65535 available ports.** Many of them used as default ports. 
- If we do not know which of these ports a server has open, then we do not have a hope of successfully attacking the target; thus, it is crucial that we begin any attack with a port scan.
- **0-1024 ports** are well-known and specified ports.
## NMAP
- Perform many different kinds of port scan 
- Nmap will connect to each port of the target in turn. Depending on the port responds, it an be determined as being open, closed or filtered (by a firewall)
- Once we know which ports are open, we can then look at enumerating which services are running on each port â€“ either manually, or more commonly using nmap.

- NMAP both used for Windows and Linux

##### PORT SCANNING
- **-sT** TCP Connect Scans
- _Three Way Handshake:
- if Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the RST (Reset) flag set. By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is closed.
- If, however, the request is sent to an open port, the target will respond with a TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set. Nmap then marks this port as being open (and completes the handshake by sending back a TCP packet with ACK set).
- Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be filtered.
- RFC 793 defined appropiate behaviour of the TCP protocol

- **-sS** SYN "Half-open" Scans
- Similar to TCP scans TCP port-range. Sometimes referreed as "Half-open" scans or "Stealth" scans.
- Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server
- bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake.
- SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. 
- Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port, SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.
- They require sudo permissions[1] in order to work correctly in Linux. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default.
- Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a production environment for the test.
- If a port is closed then the server responds with a RST TCP packet. If the port is filtered by a firewall then the TCP SYN packet is either dropped, or spoofed with a TCP reset.

-  **-sU** UDP Scans 
-  Unlike TCP, UDP connections are stateless
-  When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, Nmap refers to the port as being open|filtered. It can be open but it could be firewalled. If it gets a UDP response (which is very unusual), then the port is marked as open. 
-  In general, there is no response,  in which case the request is sent a second time as a double-check. If there is still no response then the port is marked open|filtered and Nmap moves on.
-  When the packet send to _closed_ port, target respond with an ICMP packet containing message that the port unreachable.
-  When we compare with TCP scans, these scans are much more slow so that it's usually good practice to run an Nmap scan with _--top-ports < number >_
-  nmap -sU --top-ports 20 < target > --> will scan the top 20 most commonly used UDP ports
  
- **-sN** TCP Null Scans
- when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.

- **-sF** TCP FIN Scans
- work in an almost identical fashion; however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection). Once again, Nmap expects a RST if the port is closed.

- **-sX** TCP Xmas Scans 
- send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN) give it the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark.

- NULL, FIN and Xmas scans will only ever identify ports as being open|filtered, closed, or filtered. If a port is identified as filtered with one of these scans then it is usually because the target has responded with an ICMP unreachable packet.
- In particular Microsoft Windows (and a lot of Cisco network devices) are known to respond with a RST to any malformed TCP packet -- regardless of whether the port is actually open or not.
- Reason of using these three scan types: **_firewall evasion**_

**PING SWEEP:**  Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network. When it receives a response, it marks the IP address that responded as being alive. 
- to perform a ping sweep: **-sn**
- The -sn switch tells Nmap not to scan any ports -- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets (or ARP requests on a local network, if run with sudo or directly as the root user) to identify targets. In addition to the ICMP echo requests, the -sn switch will also cause nmap to send a TCP SYN packet to port 443 of the target, as well as a TCP ACK (or TCP SYN if not run as root) packet to port 80 of the target.

##### NSE Scripting
- Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
- performs in LUA language
- safe:- Won't affect the target
- intrusive: Not safe, likely to affect the target
- vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
- exploit: Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
- auth: Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
- brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
- discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).


- NMAP scripts in Linux --> /usr/share/nmap/scripts 
- https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/
- Searching for downloaded scripts:
1. ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*
2. grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db.
3. /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db


If scripts are missing: 
- sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
- sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse). This must then be followed up with nmap --script-updatedb, which updates the script.db
5. grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
