## Offensive Security
-  break into computer systems
- expoilt software bugs 
- find loopholes 

##### Red Team
- enemy's perspective
- adversary 
- attacking an organization&providing feedback 


##### Bug Bounty

##### Brute Force
- trying many passwords to reach desired credentials

## Web Application Security 
###### Common Attacks
###### Logs of Web 
- password security --> testing the long list of passwords and finds the credentials 
###### Product 
- breach the system bu adding spesific characters 
- return data it should not or execute a progrom should 
###### Payment
- seeing payment details are sent in cleartest or using weak encryption
- **_Encryption_** : making data unreadable without knowing the secret key or password


###### Identification and Authentication Failure 
- brute force 
- easy password 
- stored passwords 

##### Broken Access Control 
- access files related to their role or work 
- failing to apply _the principle of the least privilege 
- being able to view or modify someone else's account
- browse pages that requires _authentication_ as an unauthenticated user 

##### Injection 
- user can implement _mailicous code_ as part of their input --> it can be done bc of the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the user's input 

##### Cryptographic Failures 
- **_crytography_** --> processes of encryption and decryption of data 
- **_encryption_** --> scrambles cleartest into ciphertext 
- - ensures no one can read the data without knowing the secret key 
- **_decryption_** --> converts ciphertext back into cleartext
- examples of cryptographic failures: 
- HTTP: protocol used to acces the web
- HTTPS: secure version of HTTP 
-- others can read everything you send over HTTP but not HTTPS 
- weak cryptographic algorithm 
- using default or weak keys for cryptographic functions
